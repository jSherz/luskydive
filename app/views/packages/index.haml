  Here's a list of everything you can buy through the club. Remember that most of this is subsidised by us and therefore the cheapest you'll ever get it!

%ul#packages
  -# Check we've got some packages
  - unless @packages.empty?
    -# Loop through all packages
    - @packages.each do |package|
      %li
        .package-info
          %h3
            = package.title

          - if package.requirements
            %p.requirements
              = package.requirements

          %p
            = raw(package.description)

        .package-price
          = number_to_currency(package.price, precision: 2)

  - else
    %li
      Sorry, there are no packages to display at this time!
